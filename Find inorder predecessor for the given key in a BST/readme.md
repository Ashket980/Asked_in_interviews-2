# Find inorder predecessor for the given key in a BST

**Given a BST, find the inorder predecessor of a given key in it. If the key does not lie in the BST, return the previous greater node (if any) present in the BST.**

An inorder predecessor of a node in the BST is the previous node in the inorder traversal of it. 
For example, consider the following tree:An inorder predecessor of a node in the BST is the previous node in the inorder traversal of it.
For example, consider the following tree:

    The inorder predecessor of 8 does not exist.
    The inorder predecessor of 10 is 8
    The inorder predecessor of 12 is 10
    The inorder predecessor of 20 is 16
