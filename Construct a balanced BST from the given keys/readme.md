# Construct a balanced BST from the given key

**Given an unsorted integer array that represents binary search tree (BST) keys, 
construct a height-balanced BST from it. For each node of a height-balanced tree, 
the difference between its left and right subtree height is at most 1.**

For example,

    Input: keys = [15, 10, 20, 8, 12, 16, 25]

    Output:

           15
         /    \
        10     20
       /  \   /  \
      8   12 16  25

    OR

           12
         /    \
        10    20
       /     /  \
      8     16  25
           /
          15

    OR

    Any other possible representation.
