# Find difference between sum of all nodes present at odd and even levels in a binary tree.

**Given a binary tree, calculate the difference between the sum of all nodes present at odd levels and the sum of all nodes present at even level.**

For example, consider the following binary tree. The required difference is:

(1 + 4 + 5 + 6) - (2 + 3 + 7 + 8) = -4
