# Check if the given keys represent the same BSTs or not without building BST

**Given two integer arrays, X and Y, representing a set of BST keys, check if they represent the same BSTs or 
not without building the tree. Assume that the keys are inserted into the BST in the same order as they appear in the array.**

**For example, consider the following arrays:**

**X[] = { 15, 25, 20, 22, 30, 18, 10, 8, 9, 12, 6 }**

**Y[] = { 15, 10, 12, 8, 25, 30, 6, 20, 18, 9, 22 }**

 
Both arrays represent the same BSTs, as shown below:
