## Find an index of the maximum occurring element with equal probability

**Given a non-empty integer array, find the index of the maximum occurring element with an equal probability.*

For example, consider the input: {4, 3, 6, 8, 4, 6, 2, 4, 5, 9, 7, 4}. The maximum occurring element, 4, occurs at index 0, 4, 7, and 11. 
The solution should return any one of these indices with an equal probability. If there are two maximum occurring elements in the array, 
the solution should consider the first occurring maximum element.
