# Search a given key in BST â€“ Iterative and Recursive Solution

**Given a BST, write an efficient function to search a given key in it. The algorithm should return the parent node 
of the key and print if the key is the left or right node of the parent node. If the key is not present in the BST, 
the algorithm should be able to determine that.**


**Searching a binary search tree for a specific key can be programmed recursively or iteratively.**
