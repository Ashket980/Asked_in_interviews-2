##Find preorder traversal of a binary tree from its inorder and postorder sequence
 

**Write an efficient algorithm to find a binary tree's preorder traversal from it's 
inorder and postorder sequence without constructing the tree**

**For Example, consider the following tree :**

Input:
 
Inorder traversal is { 4, 2, 1, 7, 5, 8, 3, 6 }
Postorder traversal is { 4, 2, 7, 8, 5, 6, 3, 1 }
 
 
Output:
 
The preorder traversal is { 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 7, 8, 6 }
