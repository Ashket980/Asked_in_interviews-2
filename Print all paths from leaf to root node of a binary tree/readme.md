## Print all paths from leaf to root node of a binary tree

**Given a binary tree, write a recursive algorithm to print all paths from every leaf node to root node in the binary tree.**

For example, consider the following binary tree:

There are five leaf-to-root paths in the above binary tree:

4 —> 2 —> 1
5 —> 2 —> 1
8 —> 6 —> 3 —> 1
9 —> 6 —> 3 —> 1
7 —> 3 —> 1
