## Iteratively print the leaf to root path for every leaf node in a binary tree 

**Given a binary tree, write an iterative algorithm to print the leaf-to-root path for every leaf node. Use of recursion is prohibited.**

For example, consider the following binary tree:

There are five leaf-to-root paths in the above binary tree:

4 —> 2 —> 1

5 —> 2 —> 1

8 —> 6 —> 3 —> 1

9 —> 6 —> 3 —> 1

7 —> 3 —> 1
