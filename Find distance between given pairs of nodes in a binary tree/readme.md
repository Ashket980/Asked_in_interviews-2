# Find distance between given pairs of nodes in a binary tree

**Given a binary tree, determine the distance between given pairs of nodes in it. 
The distance between two nodes is defined as the total number of edges in the shortest path from one node to other.**

For example, consider the binary tree. The distance between node 7 and node 6 is 3.
