## Construct a full binary tree from a preorder and postorder sequence

**A full binary tree is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children. Write an efficient algorithm to 
construct a full binary tree from a given preorder and postorder sequence.**

For example,

Input:
 
Preorder traversal : { 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 8, 9, 7 }
Postorder traversal: { 4, 5, 2, 8, 9, 6, 7, 3, 1 }
 
 
Output: Following full binary tree
